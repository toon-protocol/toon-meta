# FACTORY.md

Org-wide single source of truth for the **sandcastle software factory**.

Every execution repo in the `toon-protocol` org runs the same two-zone pipeline, with the
GitHub tracker as the seam:

- **Smart zone (`skills`)** — grill → spec → tickets. The human-in-the-loop half, installed
  as the `mattpocock-skills` Claude Code plugin.
- **Dumb zone (`sandcastle`)** — plan → parallel sandboxed agents → lint/typecheck/test gate
  → PR. Driven by the `@ai-hero/sandcastle` library committed as `.sandcastle/` in each repo.

This document records the values that are **decided once and apply to every repo**: the
pinned engine version, the shared conventions, the label reconciliation, the trigger-label
spec repos copy, and the per-repo factory table (filled in as each repo's factory proves out).

Tracked by epic [#178](https://github.com/toon-protocol/toon-meta/issues/178).

## Pinned engine version

**`@ai-hero/sandcastle` = `0.12.0`** — this is THE org-wide pinned version.

- **Exact-pin, org-wide.** Every repo's `.sandcastle/` pins the **same exact** version
  (`0.12.0` today). The pinned version is recorded here, once, and nowhere else is canonical.
- **Upgrades are a deliberate, cross-repo task — never automatic.** `@ai-hero/sandcastle` is
  pre-1.0 (single-maintainer). A `0.x` minor can break `init`/templates under us across all
  repos at the same time, so bumping the pin is a coordinated change across every repo, not a
  per-repo Dependabot bump.

---

## Shared conventions (decided once; apply to every repo)

| Convention            | Value                                                        |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Engine pin            | `@ai-hero/sandcastle@0.12.0` (exact, org-wide — see above)  |
| Orchestration template| `parallel-planner-with-review` (plan → implement → review)  |
| Sandbox provider      | Docker                                                       |
| Auth secret           | `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`                                    |
| Trigger labels        | `agent:implement` (+ `agent:review`) — see reconciliation   |

**Orchestration template** — `parallel-planner-with-review` is the default for every repo (the
plan → implement → review shape we want) unless a repo demonstrably needs otherwise. It is one of
the templates `npx @ai-hero/sandcastle init` offers (`blank` / `parallel-planner` /
`parallel-planner-with-review` / `sequential-reviewer` / `simple-loop`).

**Sandbox provider** — Docker. It is present on GitHub-hosted runners out of the box; if a repo
runs on self-hosted Actions, that runner must provide a Docker/Podman daemon.

**Auth secret** — `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` (from `claude setup-token`):

- Stored as an **org-level** GitHub Actions secret — this keeps the current **Max-plan** billing
  that the existing loops already use, and gives a single rotation point for all repos.
- Also stored locally in a **gitignored** `.sandcastle/.env` for local runs.
- **Explicitly NOT `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`** — using an API key would flip every repo onto **metered
  API billing** instead of the Max-plan subscription.

## Label reconciliation (old loops → sandcastle)

The new sandcastle triggers **replace** the old backlog-loop triggers; the triage vocabulary is
kept. Because the old and new triggers are **disjoint labels**, a given issue fires exactly one
engine — so old and new can coexist safely during the per-repo rollout with no double-execution.

| Old (retire *with* the loops)      | New (sandcastle)      | Notes                                                                                   |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `agent:ready` → issue-executor     | **`agent:implement`** | Same meaning ("an agent should build this"); collapse — one label means cleared *and* go. |
| `review-round:1–4` → pr-reviewer   | **`agent:review`**    | Review is one labeled action, not a 4-round loop.                                        |
| `agent:split` → issue-decomposer   | *(no label)*          | Decomposition moves to the smart zone (`/to-tickets`, human-in-loop).                    |

**Kept unchanged** (triage state, orthogonal to which engine runs):
`risk:*`, `needs:human`, `epic`, `factory`, `tracking`.

## Trigger-label spec (every repo copies these)

These two labels drive the sandcastle runners and must be created identically in every factory
repo. The label→runner is a GitHub Action (`.github/workflows/agent-*.yml`), **not** part of
`.sandcastle/`, and its guards refuse sub-issues and PRD-shaped parents.

| Label             | Color     | Meaning                                                                                              |
|-------------------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `agent:implement` | `#1D76DB` | An agent should build this. Fires the sandcastle **implement** runner (`agent-implement.yml`).        |
| `agent:review`    | `#B392F0` | One labeled review action over a PR — the single-pass replacement for the old 4-round `review-round:*` loop. Fires the **review** runner (`agent-review.yml`). |

Color rationale: `agent:implement` reuses the blue (`#1D76DB`) of the label it replaces
(`agent:ready`), keeping the "agent trigger" identity. `agent:review` takes a distinct light
purple (`#B392F0`) so the two triggers are visually separable at a glance. *(Both hexes are
proposals for the first repo to lock in — see the note at the bottom.)*

## Canonical upstreams

Track upstream. The `ALLiDoizCode/*` forks are **break-glass mirrors only** — publish from them
if upstream vanishes; **no local patches** live there, so there is no drift to reconcile.

- **Engine (dumb zone):** [`@ai-hero/sandcastle`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ai-hero/sandcastle)
  · repo [github.com/mattpocock/sandcastle](https://github.com/mattpocock/sandcastle) —
  currently **v0.12.0 (pre-1.0, single-maintainer)**.
- **Skills (smart zone):** [`mattpocock/skills`](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills) —
  installed as a Claude Code plugin
  (`/plugin marketplace add mattpocock/skills` → `/plugin install mattpocock-skills@mattpocock`),
  or via skills.sh copy-in (`npx skills@latest add mattpocock/skills`).

## Per-repo factory table

The **8 going-forward repos** — the org's live, actively-worked set. Each row is filled in as
that repo's factory proves out (image builds → dry-run `plan` passes → a real `agent:implement`
PR merges → old loops retired). All rows start **pending**.

| Repo        | Pkg mgr | Template | Gate (lint/typecheck/test/build) | Status  | Merged-PR proof | Notes |
|-------------|---------|----------|----------------------------------|---------|-----------------|-------|
| relay       | —       | —        | —                                | pending | —               | Pilot — hard checkpoint; no other repo starts until relay is end-to-end green. |
| toon-client | —       | —        | —                                | pending | —               | Proves the pattern scales to the large monorepo. |
| rig         | —       | —        | —                                | pending | —               | |
| store       | —       | —        | —                                | pending | —               | pnpm but no `lint`, esbuild build — own gate variant. |
| connector   | —       | —        | —                                | pending | —               | npm workspaces, hand-ordered build — exotic, done late. |
| toon        | —       | —        | —                                | pending | —               | Tighten the 941-warning lint budget so the gate isn't a rubber stamp. |
| swap        | —       | —        | —                                | pending | —               | |
| toon-meta   | —       | —        | —                                | pending | —               | Docs factory (markdownlint + link-check + JSON/template validation); no `package.json` yet. Sequenced last. |

**Out of scope — being archived:** `swarm` and `capability-market`. Both are active on GitHub
but ~18 days cold and not part of the going-forward set; they are being archived (`gh repo
archive`) rather than given a factory. Already-archived repos (`hub`, `town`, `Town-Frontend`)
are ignored.

## Kept workflows (not retired)

As each repo's old 4-loop backlog system (`backlog-manager.yml`, `issue-executor.yml`,
`pr-reviewer.yml`, `issue-decomposer.yml`) is retired, the following are **kept** and remain in
force: `ci.yml`, `release.yml`, `e2e.yml`, `journey.yml`, `deploy-*.yml`, and image-publish
workflows. Anything intentionally kept beyond this list should be noted in the relevant repo row
above with the reason.
