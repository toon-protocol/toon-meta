## Deferred from: code review of 46-4-live-e2e-gate-lazy-peer-node-provisioning (2026-05-11)

- `waitForExit` resolves on the `'exit'` event but Node only guarantees stdout pipe drain by `'close'`. Single-line JSON outputs rarely flake, but a chatty CLI or loaded runner can produce a truncated `lastLine` → `JSON.parse('')` failure. Shared helper used by every integration test. [packages/townhouse/src/__integration__/_test-helpers.ts:127-139]
- `cleanupContainersAndVolumes` depends on GNU `xargs -r`. BSD `xargs` (macOS default) lacks the flag; on empty match the pipe invokes `docker rm -f` with no args and exits non-zero. Try/catch masks it. Same pattern in `townhouse-hs-up.test.ts:54-91`; cross-cutting fix. [packages/townhouse/src/__integration__/townhouse-node-lifecycle-e2e.test.ts:84-87]
- Test 5 (idempotent re-up) lacks positive proof the fast path was taken. Container *names* are preserved across a cold boot, so a regression that silently falls through to cold-boot and completes in ≤30 s would pass. Compare container IDs or assert on stdout idempotency marker. [packages/townhouse/src/__integration__/townhouse-node-lifecycle-e2e.test.ts:347-380]
- Poll-loop iteration time vs budget in test 2. Each iteration spends ~1–3 s spawn + `waitForExit(10s)` + `sleep(2s)`. On a loaded CI box only 3–5 iterations may fit in the 30 s deadline. Mitigations: backoff, longer per-iteration budget. [packages/townhouse/src/__integration__/townhouse-node-lifecycle-e2e.test.ts:257-279]
- `hs up` re-run 30 s budget ignores cold-boot fallback. If the connector transiently reports `hostname: null` between tests, the idempotency probe falls through to cold-boot which has no inner budget — the 30 s `waitForExit` SIGKILLs mid-boot, corrupting state for `afterAll`. Low probability. [packages/townhouse/src/__integration__/townhouse-node-lifecycle-e2e.test.ts:353-359]
- `dockerPs` / `volumeExists` `execSync` calls have no timeout. A hung dockerd freezes the test until vitest's outer budget kills the worker, producing "test exceeded timeout" instead of "docker ps hung". Adding `timeout: 15_000` improves diagnostics but drifts from the `townhouse-hs-up.test.ts:54-91` template; cross-cutting decision. [packages/townhouse/src/__integration__/townhouse-node-lifecycle-e2e.test.ts:66-80]
- `runCli` `stderr` buffer is declared on `RunCliResult` but never populated. `stdio: ['ignore', 'pipe', 'inherit']` means stderr inherits to the runner's TTY but isn't attached to assertion-failure messages. Shared helper issue. [packages/townhouse/src/__integration__/_test-helpers.ts:62-118]

## Deferred from: code review of 45-3-docker-orchestrator-profile-param (2026-05-10, round 3)

- `up()` mutates `this.activeNodes` before HS-path validation rejects unknown profiles — pre-existing pattern in dev path; HS-path's new `OrchestratorError` for unknown profile types interacts with it but doesn't fundamentally change the picture. [packages/townhouse/src/docker/orchestrator.ts:279,320-334]
- `upHs` does not roll back successfully-started compose containers when `waitForHsHostname` later times out — operator must `townhouse hs down` manually before re-invoking. Story 45.4 retry-policy territory. [packages/townhouse/src/docker/orchestrator.ts:343-376]
- `surfaceComposeFailure` pattern 3 hardcodes `townhouse-hs-` container-name prefix — silently dead code for operators who set `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME`. [packages/townhouse/src/docker/orchestrator.ts:389]
- Integration test `docker ps --filter name=townhouse-hs-` is a substring filter — pollutes on a host with leftover state or a parallel townhouse stack. [packages/townhouse/src/__integration__/orchestrator-hs.test.ts:90,107]
- HS `up()` ENOENT path attributes failure to "docker CLI not found on PATH" — could equally mean the compose plugin is missing. [packages/townhouse/src/docker/orchestrator.ts:360-361]
- `runDockerCompose` silently drops stderr chunks past 16 MB without truncation marker. [packages/townhouse/src/docker/orchestrator.ts:78-83]
- HS `waitForHsHostname` "polls until non-null" unit test uses real timers (~6 s wall clock) — slows CI marginally, correctness fine. [packages/townhouse/src/docker/orchestrator-hs.test.ts]
- `waitForHsHostname` deadline can overrun the advertised 120 s by ~7 s when each request takes ~5 s and the deadline check happens before the call. [packages/townhouse/src/docker/orchestrator.ts:419]
- `waitForHsHostname` uses `Date.now()` for the deadline — laptop suspend/resume + system clock backward jump can extend the timeout indefinitely. Future hardening (`process.hrtime.bigint()`). [packages/townhouse/src/docker/orchestrator.ts:414,419]
- `downHs` is not idempotent when nothing is running — exits 0 with WARN on some Compose versions, exits 1 on others. CLI consumers (Story 45.4) need to handle gracefully.
- `downHs` 60 s timeout may be tight for 3-peer HS stacks where each container's SIGTERM grace is 10 s. Tune on evidence. [packages/townhouse/src/docker/orchestrator.ts:570]
- HS-path fake-timer tests are sensitive to microtask ordering between `getHsHostname` mock resolution and `setTimeout` advance. Tests pass; refactor is style. [packages/townhouse/src/docker/orchestrator-hs.test.ts:660-685]

## Deferred from: code review of 44-4-connector-release-contract-cross-repo-doc (2026-05-08)

- Bare `CONNECTOR_MIGRATION.md` reference in body-identical mirror is a dangling reference from the connector-side reader's perspective (file lives only in town). Acceptable trade-off for byte-equivalence discipline; consider path-qualifying as `packages/sdk/CONNECTOR_MIGRATION.md (in toon-protocol/town)` in a future tightening pass. — [`packages/sdk/CONNECTOR_RELEASE_CONTRACT.md` `### Townhouse pin discipline`]
- No in-file breadcrumb in connector source pointing to the town mirror — the asymmetric `tail -n +4` discipline lives entirely inside the doc body (`## Verification` section). A single HTML comment at the top of the connector file (`<!-- Mirrored at toon-protocol/town:packages/sdk/CONNECTOR_RELEASE_CONTRACT.md -->`) would make the relationship discoverable without breaking the diff invariant. Follow-up commit on the connector side. — [`/home/jonathan/Documents/connector/CONNECTOR_RELEASE_CONTRACT.md:1`]
- `image-manifest.json` referenced in present tense in the new `### Townhouse pin discipline` paragraph; the file does not yet exist (Story 45.1 will produce it). Forward-applying language is the explicit intent — verb tense to be revisited when 45.1 lands. — [`packages/sdk/CONNECTOR_RELEASE_CONTRACT.md` `### Townhouse pin discipline`]
- PATCH-bump exception clause "...unless the patch fixes a behavior townhouse actively relied on being broken" is unfalsifiable. Reviewer cannot apply mechanically. Could be tightened to a procedural gate (e.g., "...unless the contract canary turns red on the new digest"). Cross-repo follow-up. — [`packages/sdk/CONNECTOR_RELEASE_CONTRACT.md` `### Townhouse pin discipline`]

## Resolved from: code review of 44-4-... (2026-05-08, post-merge polish cycle)

_Six cross-repo patches (P3, P4, P5, P6, P7, Q1) shipped in lock-step via [connector#68](https://github.com/toon-protocol/connector/pull/68) + [town#36](https://github.com/toon-protocol/town/pull/36) on 2026-05-08. Body-equivalence diff returned empty post-merge. Resolved._

## Deferred from: code review of 21-15-ator-privacy-transport-and-connectivity-status (2026-05-01)

- AC-5 validateConfig round-trip failure path untested — implementation is correct, only the assertion is missing. [packages/townhouse/src/api/routes/transport.ts:146-161]
- AC-3 rollback test asserts mock `saveConfig` call count, not actual on-disk reversion — true integration test would need a temp filesystem. [packages/townhouse/src/api/routes/transport.test.ts:278-297]
- No-op detection runs before mutex acquire (AC-3 ordering deviation) — no mutation occurs and AC accepts either ordering operationally. [packages/townhouse/src/api/routes/transport.ts:120-131]
- Concurrent GET during PATCH torn read — single-machine sub-Hz operation; consequence is one stale poll. [packages/townhouse/src/api/routes/transport.ts]
- PATCH allows `activeNodes === []` (connector restart with no peers) — pre-existing pattern shared with nodes-patch.ts. [packages/townhouse/src/api/routes/transport.ts:167-169]
- Module-level mutex potential dual-import (esm/cjs) — pure-ESM monorepo; only manifests under future bundler change. [packages/townhouse/src/api/config-mutex.ts]
- `<TransportStatusPanel>` `lastProbedAt > 24 h ago` renders as "500 hr ago" — only manifests if probe is broken (its own surfaced state). [packages/townhouse-web/src/components/TransportStatusPanel.tsx:7-14]
- `<SettingsView>` no-op success has no user feedback — Save button disable handles the practical case. [packages/townhouse-web/src/views/Settings.tsx]
- AC-20 SPA-side `import.meta.env.DEV` guard absent — server-side hook in dev API server is equivalent (script never ships in production builds). [packages/townhouse-web/scripts/api-server.mjs]
- Massive prettier reformatting drift across 60+ files — required by Dev Notes "Lint/format after every set of file edits"; no semantic changes detected in sampled files.

## Deferred from: code review of 21-13-dashboard-wallet-and-keys-view (2026-04-30)

- Multi-chain RPC mapping (per-`nodeType` RPC URL) for non-EVM withdrawal — story is EVM-only single-RPC v1 per Dev Notes § Withdrawal scope; revisit when Solana/Mina send-side lands. [packages/townhouse/src/api/routes/wallet-withdraw.ts]
- Burn-address (`0x0000…0000`) confirm step in WithdrawModal — devtool scope, not blocking. [packages/townhouse-web/src/components/WithdrawModal.tsx step 3]
- Self-send warning when `recipient === wallet address` — not in spec. [packages/townhouse-web/src/components/WithdrawModal.tsx step 3]
- Cache key including `rpcUrl` for multi-RPC environments — single-RPC v1. [packages/townhouse/src/api/routes/wallet-balances.ts]
- Mnemonic JS-string secure-zero (true buffer wipe) — JS string immutability; spec's "zero out from React state" is met. Future hardening would need a `Uint8Array` shape end-to-end (route → JSON → React). [packages/townhouse-web/src/components/RevealSeedModal.tsx]
- `formatDerivationPath` hard-codes account-index at split-slot 3 — works for current BIP-44 schemas (EVM/Nostr/Solana/Mina). Future-proof if a non-standard path is added. [packages/townhouse-web/src/components/AddressBlock.tsx]
- `keyInfo.solanaAddress`/`minaAddress` for non-mill nodeTypes silently ignored — current spec only Mill exposes those chains. [packages/townhouse/src/api/routes/wallet-balances.ts task generation]
- Reveal endpoint rate-limit / brute-force backoff — Threat model § acknowledges localhost-only mitigation; needed if remote bind becomes supported. [packages/townhouse/src/api/routes/wallet-reveal.ts]
- Solana/Mina RPC hung-task wedge — 3 s per-fetch timeout already; aggregate circuit-breaker is future hardening. [packages/townhouse/src/chain/{solana-rpc,mina-graphql}.ts]
- AddressBlock `<details>` `aria-expanded` mirroring — browser handles natively today; revisit if assistive-tech reports gaps. [packages/townhouse-web/src/components/AddressBlock.tsx]
- USDC-capture script `tail -n1 | sed` parsing brittleness — works with current `deploy-mock-usdc.sh` output format. Harden if the deploy script signature changes. [scripts/townhouse-dev-infra.sh:160-176]

## Deferred from: code review of 21-12-dashboard-dvm-management-view (2026-04-30)

- PATCH `/api/nodes/dvm/config` is type-level not instance-level — slider on `dev-dvm-01` card applies to all DVM nodes. `void nodeId` comment in the diff acknowledges. The 21.11 multi-instance refactor scoped health/swaps/deposit-addresses by `:nodeId` but did not refactor PATCH. Promote to per-instance scope in a future story. [packages/townhouse-web/src/views/Dvm.tsx handleApplyKindFee, packages/townhouse/src/api/routes/nodes-patch.ts]
- `useDvmJobsRecent` polling doesn't pause when tab is backgrounded — codebase-wide pattern (no other hook gates on `document.visibilityState`). Address as a cross-cutting improvement. [packages/townhouse-web/src/hooks/useDvmJobsRecent.ts:84]
- Refetch + interval-tick race may overwrite fresh data with stale; add monotonic request id. [packages/townhouse-web/src/hooks/useDvmJobsRecent.ts:54-95]
- `BigInt(entry.amount)` throws on non-decimal amount strings — connector contract concern; current connector emits decimal strings only. [packages/townhouse/src/api/routes/nodes.ts:602,610]
- Connector-down asymmetry: `swaps/recent` returns 200/empty, `jobs/recent` returns 503. Reconcile in a future tidy-up. [packages/townhouse/src/api/routes/nodes.ts:539-549 vs :436-447]
- `windowSec=0050` leading-zero passes regex — cosmetic. [packages/townhouse/src/api/routes/nodes.ts:867-882]
- Number → BigInt precision loss for `kindPricing` values > MAX_SAFE_INTEGER — rare (>9 quadrillion fees). [docker/src/entrypoint-dvm.ts:424-426]
- `primaryKind.reduce` ties broken by insertion order (non-deterministic) — cosmetic; tie-break by `kind` ascending if needed. [packages/townhouse-web/src/views/Dvm.tsx:147-150]
- Static-analysis tests duplicated between `dvm-dockerfile.test.ts` and `entrypoint-dvm.test.ts` — pre-existing pattern (mill has same dual-test setup). [packages/townhouse/src/docker/dvm-dockerfile.test.ts:1112-1137, docker/src/entrypoint-dvm.test.ts:1443-1469]
- `KIND_PRICING_0=N` silently accepted (kind:0 is Nostr profile metadata, not a DVM job kind) — no functional harm; UI iterates handlerKinds (won't include 0). [docker/src/entrypoint-dvm.ts:308-316]
- Counter `processing` not decremented on unhandled rejection inside the wrapped handler — Promise wrapping in v1 catches all rejections; real risk only if handler launches fire-and-forget work that throws. [docker/src/entrypoint-dvm.ts:83-96]
- Clock skew / non-monotonic `Date.now()` breaks event eviction invariant — rare NTP step. [docker/src/entrypoint-dvm.ts:76-81]
- AbortError on timeout briefly flips status loading→error→ready — minor UX flicker. [packages/townhouse-web/src/hooks/useDvmJobsRecent.ts:67-78]
- `DvmFeeSlider` `isDirty` microtask race — drag during success-path setIsDirty(false) — rare race window. [packages/townhouse-web/src/views/Dvm.tsx:2537-2539]
- `/jobs/recent` returns 200/zero with no degraded indicator when ilpAddress is missing — caller can't distinguish "no jobs" from "address unknown"; consider a `degraded: true` field in a future tidy-up. [packages/townhouse/src/api/routes/nodes.ts:928-939]
- Health response cached without shape validation — improvement not bug; container-side trust boundary. [packages/townhouse/src/api/routes/nodes.ts:909-911]
- VITEST env-var gate is fragile — use `import.meta.url === pathToFileURL(process.argv[1]).href` if a different test runner is ever introduced. [docker/src/entrypoint-dvm.ts:247-255]

## Deferred from: code review of 21-11-dashboard-mill-management-view (2026-04-30)

- Fee slider doesn't proactively transition the card to `loading` while the PATCH is in flight; transition is purely WS-driven (`connectorRestarting` / `connectorRestarted`). Matches the 21.10 TownView pattern explicitly referenced by AC-16; changing this view alone would diverge from the precedent. Re-evaluate if a unified loading approach is adopted across both views. [packages/townhouse-web/src/views/Mill.tsx MillFeeSlider]
- `/nodes/:type/packets/timeseries` and `/nodes/:type` (and `useNodeMetrics`/`usePacketTimeseries`) are still per-type, so the volume chart and current-fee aggregate across all mill instances. The 21.11 multi-instance refactor only covered health / swaps/recent / deposit-addresses. Promote these to per-instance scoping in a future story when DVM views land.

## Deferred from: code review of 21-10-dashboard-town-management-view (2026-04-30)

- `getPacketLog` 404 detection via error message string matching — `msg.includes('404')` on the thrown error string works for all realistic cases; refactor to status-code inspection if `ConnectorAdminClient.fetch()` is ever restructured to not throw on non-200 responses. [packages/townhouse/src/connector/admin-client.ts:157]
- Double `regenerateConnectorConfig` when `enabled` flip + fee change arrive in one PATCH body — two sequential restarts in rapid succession; pre-existing in the 21.8 PATCH handler, not introduced by 21.10. [packages/townhouse/src/api/routes/nodes-patch.ts]
- Inline `rgba(0,0,0,0.06)` in `CartesianGrid` stroke — rgba is not hex; the `no-inline-hex` lint rule targets hex strings only and CI passes. Revisit if the rule is expanded to cover rgba/hsl. [packages/townhouse-web/src/views/Town.tsx:239]
- `getNodeRelayEndpoint` Docker-internal fallback (`ws://townhouse-<id>:7100`) unreachable when Townhouse API runs on the host — fallback is intentional for Townhouse-in-Docker (Oyster CVM) deployments; dev stack and production single-instance deployments use the port-binding path. [packages/townhouse/src/docker/orchestrator.ts:229]
- `useNodeMetrics` uses `nodeType` (e.g., `'town'`) not `nodeId` (e.g., `'town-01'`) — both Town cards show identical metrics; per-instance isolation requires a new `/api/nodes/:type/:id` API surface (future story). [packages/townhouse-web/src/views/Town.tsx:331-332]
- Bandwidth always `null`/`'—'` in dev stack — `GET /nodes/:type/bandwidth` builds container name as `townhouse-town` but dev stack containers are named `townhouse-dev-town-01`; works correctly in single-instance production. [packages/townhouse/src/api/routes/nodes.ts:291]

## Deferred from: code review of 21-7-5-connector-version-sweep-and-contract-canary (2026-04-29)

- SOCKS_PROXY empty-string is inconsistent: `ConnectorConfigGenerator.generate()` keeps an empty `socksProxy` in the runtime config (`?? DEFAULT_ATOR_PROXY` only kicks on null/undefined), but `toEnvVars()` then drops the key via a truthy check. Pre-existing in `config-generator.ts`; story does not modify that file. [packages/townhouse/src/connector/config-generator.ts]
- `ConnectorAdminClient.getPeers()` returns typed `PeerStatus[]` but does not validate per-element shape — `[null]` / `[42]` / `[{ totally: 'random' }]` pass `Array.isArray()`. Story explicitly scope-excludes admin-client modifications; future fix should align with the admin-client path/shape gap already documented in `CONNECTOR_MIGRATION.md §Known Contract Gaps`. [packages/townhouse/src/connector/admin-client.ts:77-84]
- `inspect()` race: on slow systems (Docker-on-Mac VM, CI under load), `start()` resolves on container-state=running, not on port-forwarding-complete. `Ports['9401/tcp']` may be `null` momentarily; `expect.toBeTruthy()` fires on transient race rather than real regression. Speculative — address if it actually flakes. [packages/townhouse/src/__integration__/connector-image-contract.test.ts:139-150]
- `getHealth()` validator accepts `NaN`/`Infinity`/negative `uptime` (`typeof NaN === 'number'`). A buggy connector emitting `NaN` (divide-by-zero) silently propagates to consumers. Pre-existing in admin-client. [packages/townhouse/src/connector/admin-client.ts:40-47]
- Stub canary lacks coverage for empty / single-element / very-large `activeNodes` cases. The story's spec required a specific 3-node case and a SOCKS_PROXY case; broader coverage was not in scope. [packages/townhouse/src/connector/contract-canary.test.ts]
- No escaping of pathological values (NUL byte, newline) in `toEnvArray()` joining `${KEY}=${VALUE}`. dockerode passes verbatim to the kernel which interprets NUL as terminator. Pre-existing in config-generator. [packages/townhouse/src/connector/config-generator.ts:81-84]
- Image-pull has no `AbortController` / retry / timeout. A hung pull blocks `beforeAll` for the full 30s; vitest then aborts mid-pull leaving partial layers. Pre-existing pattern; address with a CI-side image-prepull step if flakiness emerges. [packages/townhouse/src/__integration__/connector-image-contract.test.ts:76-92]

## Deferred from: code review of 22-5-connector-interface-contract-smoke-test (2026-04-28)

- Action pinning is half-applied in `.github/workflows/test.yml` — new canary job pins to commit SHAs (OWASP A08), pre-existing jobs in the same file still use floating `@v4` tags. Either the threat is real for the whole file or the rationale is theatrical. Tracked for a follow-up workflow-wide pinning sweep.
- Vitest filename filter `pnpm test:integration -- tests/integration/connector-contract.test.ts` is a substring match. A rename of the canary file without updating the CI command would silently run the entire integration suite under the 5-minute cap and time out as a false-red.
- No `beforeEach`/`afterEach` teardown of `vi.fn` mocks in `connector-contract.test.ts`. Speculative — not a bug today; matters only if shared module mocks are added later.

## Deferred from: code review of 21-7-dvm-node-dockerfile (2026-04-21)

- Health check doesn't verify JSON response — Static test cannot validate runtime health endpoint behavior, requires actual Docker run
- Process.env secret deletion ineffective — This is how Node.js works - env vars are process-local. True secrets require Docker-level handling which is out of scope
- rot-js dependency not explicitly bundled — Relies on transitive inclusion through pet-dvm, can verify at Docker build time

## Deferred from: code review of 21-8-fastify-rest-websocket-metrics-api (2026-04-21)

- `saveConfig` re-validates full config on every write — migration hazard if future required fields are added (config-schema evolution concern, not 21.8) [packages/townhouse/src/config/loader.ts]
- `saveConfig` atomic-rename cross-device / Windows semantics — Townhouse is Linux-first per epic scope
- Module-level `isMutating` + `resetConfigMutex` test-seam export — behaviorally correct for single-process v1; refactor into factory-scoped closure [packages/townhouse/src/api/routes/nodes-patch.ts]

## Deferred from: code review of 21-8-fastify-rest-websocket-metrics-api (2026-04-21)

- `cli.test.ts:114-115` and `cli-wallet.test.ts:95-96` MockInstance generics mismatch — pre-existing vitest typing issue unrelated to 21.8.
- `connector/config-generator.test.ts:93,194` possibly-undefined access — pre-existing.
- `wallet/manager.test.ts:229,232` index-signature cast — pre-existing.
- `buildCorsOptions` omits `HEAD` from methods — low severity; no caller uses HEAD today.
- `server.ts` error handler leaks `error.message` outside production — matches spec Dev Note intent (log full error server-side, return safe message); message leak is low risk given loopback-only bind.

## Deferred from: code review of 22-4-fix-sdk-solana-settlement-e2e (2026-04-28)

- Mixed commitment levels — `getAccountInfo` upgraded to `'confirmed'`, but `getLatestBlockhash` / `requestAirdrop` retain defaults; theoretical flake source [packages/sdk/tests/e2e/docker-solana-settlement-e2e.test.ts]
- Account index u8 wraparound at >255 accounts in legacy-message serializer [packages/sdk/tests/e2e/docker-solana-settlement-e2e.test.ts]
- `compactU16Size` / `writeCompactU16` invariant lacks runtime assert at slice point — risks silent corruption if future divergence
- `.env.sdk-e2e` parser doesn't handle quoted values, comments, or whitespace-padded values [packages/sdk/tests/e2e/helpers/docker-e2e-setup.ts:90]
- Hand-rolled base58 encoder — all-zero pubkey returns `'1'`, no validation [packages/sdk/tests/e2e/helpers/docker-e2e-setup.ts:104-131]
- Module-load side effects — `loadSdkE2eEnv()` runs once at import, `SOLANA_PROGRAM_ID` is a resolved-once `const`; stale across vitest worker re-imports [packages/sdk/tests/e2e/helpers/docker-e2e-setup.ts:102,134]
- `expect(channelAfterSettle).toBeNull()` assumes connector v3.3.2 closes the channel account on settle — semantic shift from prior `state==='settled'` check; should be confirmed against connector source
- Auto-keypair `--bpf-program` branch in entrypoint passes `.so` as both address and program path [infra/solana/entrypoint.sh:29] — only triggers when `*-keypair.json` missing
- `deriveSolanaProgramIdFromKeypair` returns `'1'` (system program) for all-zero pubkey input [packages/sdk/tests/e2e/helpers/docker-e2e-setup.ts:127]
- `discoverProgramId` returns first program from RPC enumeration order — fragile if multiple BPF programs are loaded [packages/sdk/tests/e2e/docker-solana-settlement-e2e.test.ts]


## Deferred from: code review of 21-6-1-mill-review-findings-remediation (2026-04-29)

- Shutdown test `emitAndAwaitShutdown` yields one `setImmediate` tick — sufficient with trivial mock, brittle if `stop()` ever does real async work. Consider `vi.waitFor()` pattern.
- `process.removeAllListeners` in `afterEach` is indiscriminate — silently removes any future Vitest or plugin signal handlers registered on the worker. Scope to known test-registered listeners.
- `applyEnvOverlay` regression sanity test uses `as never` cast, suppressing compile-time type-checking on the stub input.
- `Dockerfile.mill` `LABEL version="1.0.0"` is a hardcoded literal — not parameterized via `--build-arg`. Every image build reports 1.0.0 regardless of actual package version.
- `MILL_CONFIG_PATH` file containing the string `"null"` bypasses the empty-file guard and produces a raw `TypeError` from `parseRawConfig` instead of a wrapped error.
- AC-5 line citations in `21-6-mill-node-dockerfile-review-findings.md` drifted ~6 lines after prettier pass (`b161cd4`) — `delete` cited at `:188-189` actual `:195`; `SIGQUIT` cited at `:335` actual `:354`.

## Deferred from: code review of 21-8-0-townhouse-dev-infrastructure (2026-04-29)

- SOCKS5 service has no healthcheck — silent failure if port collision; only consumed by story 21.15 (ATOR transport).
- `MILL_RELAYS` env in `docker-compose-townhouse-dev.yml:303,343` duplicates fixture `relayUrls` and overrides via `applyEnvOverlay`; Dev Agent Record acknowledged the intentional override.
- `dev-fixtures.test.ts:66-67` validates `cumulativeAmount`/`nonce` with `Number()` — loses precision >2^53; current fixture values fit safely.
- Smoke test workspace-root resolution via four-level relative path (`dev-stack-smoke.test.ts:45`) is fragile to file relocation but currently correct.
- Anvil compose entrypoint and host `deploy-mock-usdc.sh` both attempt USDC deploy; resolved as part of patch finding #7 if user opts to drop the host call.

## Deferred from: code review of 21-8-5-dashboard-design-system-foundation (2026-04-29)

- `Home.tsx` placeholder lacks AbortController, no `r.ok` check, possible duplicate-type key collision — placeholder for 21.9-lite (`packages/townhouse-web/src/pages/Home.tsx:24-32`).
- `chart.tsx` uses `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with developer-controlled color values — shadcn-generated; revisit when user-controllable colors are introduced.
- `tsconfig.build.json` excludes `src/components/ui/**` from typecheck — known shadcn `@ts-nocheck` workaround; revisit when shadcn types stabilize.
- `no-inline-hex` `TemplateLiteral` regex is unanchored — would false-positive on URI-like strings containing `#abc...`; no current call sites trigger it.
- `no-direct-recharts` doesn't catch CJS `require('recharts')` — codebase is ESM-only; defer until/unless CJS is introduced.
- `no-positive-letter-spacing-geist` regex allow-list permits `tracking-tight-${anything-positive}` — current tokens are all negative by design.
- Storybook `viteFinal` spreads `viteConfig.resolve.alias` as object — Vite supports array form too; would drop existing aliases. Revisit if Storybook ever adds array-form aliases.
- `MetricBlock` `value: number` not localized via `toLocaleString()` — caller responsibility per spec; consider adding a `format` prop in a future view story.
- `dev-docker.mjs` doesn't explicitly forward parent SIGINT/SIGTERM — `concurrently --kill-others` + `shell: true` handle it in practice; tighten if orphan processes appear in smoke testing.
- `index.css` font URLs use `../node_modules/geist/...` — fragile to pnpm hoisting changes; pinned to pnpm 8.15.0 currently. Switch to `import 'geist/...?url'` if hoisting drifts.

## Deferred from: code review of 21-9-dashboard-spa-home-view (2026-04-29)

- AC-3 hook surface keying differs from spec (`useNodeStatusStream` returns `statesByName: Record<string, string>` rather than `Map<NodeType, NodeState>`). Documented in Dev Notes "Implementation Plan" #2 as deliberate. Revisit if a stricter type contract is needed for richer view stories.
- AC-5 transport-status indicator is static (reflects configured `transport.mode` only, not live ATOR proxy reachability). Gated behind story 21.15 per spec's plumbing-decision clause; TODO comment in `Home.tsx:866-869`.
- AC-9 (live-Docker screenshot) and AC-10 (`docker pause townhouse-dev-town-02` degraded demo) — explicit PR-review gate per spec. Dev Agent flagged that the dev-stack container-name caveat may block AC-10 until 21.14 fixtures land or the orchestrator is wired to dev fixtures.

## Deferred from: code review of 21-14-first-run-setup-wizard (2026-05-01)

- AC-13 `<WizardHeader>` component / left-aligned breadcrumb missing — inline progress indicator satisfies the user-facing requirement; resolution depends on Decision-needed item in story file (extract component or amend AC).
- Per-step component test files absent (`WizardStepNodes.test.tsx`, `WizardStepWallet.test.tsx`, `WizardStepPrivacy.test.tsx`, `WizardStepFees.test.tsx`, `WizardStepLaunch.test.tsx`) — `Wizard.test.tsx` covers basic flows; per-step coverage of regenerate confirm-discard, password-mismatch caption, slider bounds, summary card, error-code mapping, axe assertions left for a follow-up test-coverage story.
- `cli/browser-opener.test.ts` not in diff — cross-platform spawn-arg shape coverage (`open` / `xdg-open` / `cmd /c start` per Dev Notes) absent; defer to a follow-up.
- `useWizardState` polls every 2s forever (even after `containers_running: true`) — wasted requests on idle Home view; bounded by SPA tab lifetime; consider stopping the poll once normal mode is stable.
- Mnemonic internal-multi-space + ZWSP/Unicode-invisible normalization on import — current `\s+` split handles common whitespace; uncommon paste paths fall through to a generic "Invalid BIP-39" error.
- AC-4 validation cascade order in impl differs slightly from spec list order (length before mismatch); both still produce a 400 with a `code`; tests don't pin ordering — align spec or impl in a future polish pass.

## Deferred from: code review of 45-2-embed-compose-templates-and-image-manifest-in-npm-tarball (2026-05-09)

- Concurrent `materializeComposeTemplate('hs')` calls race — `mkdirSync` + `chmodSync` + `writeFileSync` is non-atomic; no `tmp + rename` pattern. Low likelihood unless townhouse-api restarts during a CLI invocation.
- `defaultDistDir()` `import.meta.url` resolution assumes tsup output layout — fragile under future bundlers (esbuild/vite/webpack inlining the source). Forward-looking concern for Story 45.4+ when bundled CLI imports the loader.
- No idempotency guard on `pnpm publish` rerun — npm returns 409 if version already published. Workflow rerun on the same `v*` tag fails loudly but ungracefully. Add a pre-flight `npm view ... || pnpm publish ...` shim later.
- `tarball-contents.test.ts` parses `pnpm pack` stdout (`result.trim().split('\n').pop()`) — brittle if pnpm 9+ changes output format or adds trailing summary lines. Fallback `readdirSync` saves it; tighten to readdir-only when convenient.
- `DOCKER_AVAILABLE=1` env override skips real daemon probe in `compose-template-validity.test.ts` — when daemon is dead, test crashes after a 30s timeout instead of cleanly skipping. Add a pre-test `docker info --format '{{.ID}}'` probe.
- Lifecycle-script asymmetry between `pnpm pack` (verify step) and `pnpm publish` (live step) — `prepublishOnly` runs only on publish. If a future PR adds `prepublishOnly: pnpm build`, `tsup`'s `clean: true` wipes the manifest and ships unsubstituted YAML undetected. Add `--ignore-scripts` to the live-publish step.
- Brief TOCTOU readability between `writeFileSync(manifestPath, ..., { mode: 0o600 })` and the follow-up `chmodSync(manifestPath, 0o600)` — on filesystems where the mode option is umask-masked (WSL2), another local process can `open(O_RDONLY)` between the two calls. Marginal — manifest itself is not secret, but the same pattern is used for compose YAML which can carry env-injected secrets.
- `tsup.config.ts onSuccess` and `scripts/render-compose-template.mjs` duplicate the placeholder-substitution arrays (5 entries each). Drift risk when adding a 6th image — refactor to a shared `renderComposeTemplate(distDir, srcDir)` module imported by both.
- `pnpm pack --pack-destination` requires pnpm ≥ 8.4 (added in v7.18 actually — but `--filter` + `--pack-destination` interaction was solidified in 8.4). The workflow's `pnpm/action-setup` version is not visible in this diff — verify it's pinned to ≥ 8.4 to avoid silent flag-ignored failures.

## Deferred from: code review of 45-2-embed-compose-templates-and-image-manifest-in-npm-tarball — Round 2 (2026-05-09)

- D3-Patch port-collision documentation in HS template + README is technically incorrect — host ports HS/dev don't actually overlap. The "must not run concurrently" guidance is a reasonable defensive default but cite the right mechanism (canonical ports may collide with non-townhouse system services rather than each other).
- `describe.skipIf` inverted-logic sibling pattern in compose-template-validity.test.ts only emits a visible "skipped" line in the file-missing case; in the normal case (file present), the sibling describe is silently absent. Refactor to emit a single skip from inside the main describe.
- TOCTOU between manifest existence check and copy in `materializeComposeTemplate` (race with concurrent `pnpm install --force`). Low likelihood; consider switching to read-then-write pattern with single fs.readFile that throws on missing.
- `loadComposeTemplate` ENOENT race between `existsSync` check and `readFileSync` propagates raw `fs.Error` instead of wrapped `ComposeLoaderError`. Caller `catch (e instanceof ComposeLoaderError)` mis-routes.
- `compose-template-validity.test.ts` `0\.0\.0\.0:` reject misses YAML long-form `host_ip: 0.0.0.0\n` (no trailing colon).
- Connector image cache check in `connector-image-contract.test.ts` uses `includes(parsedRef.digest!)` — substring match where `endsWith('@' + digest)` would be safer.
- `tarball-contents.test.ts` afterAll cleanup deletes the tarball even on test failure, killing post-mortem inspection. Consider keeping the tarball when an assertion fails (vitest's task context exposes failure state).
- Manifest-alignment test path resolution via `import.meta.url + '../../dist/...'` is fragile under bundler reconfiguration. Same pattern is acknowledged in compose-loader.ts:30.
- `tarball-contents.test.ts` "freshness precondition" only checks `existsSync(DIST_COMPOSE_HS)` — stale dist (e.g., dev rebuilt last week, manifest changed since) passes the gate. Add mtime-vs-source comparison or a digest cross-check against current `image-manifest.json`.

## Deferred from: code review of 45-3-docker-orchestrator-profile-param (2026-05-09)

- README documents the anon-disabled error message verbatim — drift hazard between code and doc. Recommend exporting the message string as a const both code and doc reference. [`packages/townhouse/README.md` § "DockerOrchestrator Profiles"]
- Magic numbers (timeouts: 120_000 / 2_000 / 5_000 / 180_000 / 60_000; maxBuffer 16 MiB; stderr truncation 500) not named constants. [`packages/townhouse/src/docker/orchestrator.ts`]
- AC #5 ECONNREFUSED retry-within-budget path has no dedicated unit test — branch in `waitForHsHostname` swallows non-anon-disabled errors and continues, but no test asserts the retry behavior. AC #12 didn't enumerate this case. [`packages/townhouse/src/docker/orchestrator-hs.test.ts`]
- AC #12 "constructor stores profile/composePath" assertion is `instanceof`-only — private fields never observably verified. Consider `Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor`/`@ts-expect-error` access or a behavior-driven check. [`packages/townhouse/src/docker/orchestrator-hs.test.ts:479-491`]
- Integration test container assertion uses substring `name=townhouse-hs-` filter — pollutes when host has leftover containers from prior runs. Use exact-name filter or list-and-include. [`packages/townhouse/src/__integration__/orchestrator-hs.test.ts:161-167`]
- Integration test relies on vitest `it`-order: third `it` calls `orch.down()` and asserts `townhouse-hs-anon` volume survives, while `afterAll` runs `down -v`. Order-dependence not enforced. [`packages/townhouse/src/__integration__/orchestrator-hs.test.ts`]
- `process.env['TOWNHOUSE_WALLET_PASSWORD']` mutated in `beforeAll` without try/finally restore — leaks across worker reuse if `beforeAll` throws between set and the matching `afterAll` delete. [`packages/townhouse/src/__integration__/orchestrator-hs.test.ts:129, :153`]
- No partial-failure rollback when `docker compose up` exits non-zero or times out — Node's `timeout` kills the CLI but dockerd keeps going, leaving a half-started stack. Story 45.4 retry policy will dictate whether to attempt `docker compose down` in the catch path. [`packages/townhouse/src/docker/orchestrator.ts:213-231`]
- User-visible `OrchestratorError` message truncates stderr to 500 chars; full stderr preserved on `error.stderr` field but human-readable diagnostic is gutted for multi-line compose YAML errors. [`packages/townhouse/src/docker/orchestrator.ts:228, :432`]
- `composePath` not validated as absolute or existing on disk at construct time — defense-in-depth gap. Current callers pass paths from `materializeComposeTemplate` so the gap is only relevant to direct API consumers. [`packages/townhouse/src/docker/orchestrator.ts:159`]
- Non-503 / non-200 statuses (404 from a connector pre-v3.5.0 without the endpoint, 500, 502) are silently retried for the full 120s budget. AC #5 specifies 503 fast-fail and ECONNREFUSED retry but is silent on other statuses; could fast-fail 404 with an actionable "connector pre-v3.5.0" diagnostic. [`packages/townhouse/src/docker/orchestrator.ts:284-294`]
- `activeNodes` mutated before `upHs/upDev` could fail — leaves stale state on error. Pre-existing in dev path; flagged for symmetry. Move assignment to after success or implement actual-state tracking in a follow-up. [`packages/townhouse/src/docker/orchestrator.ts:174`]

## Deferred from: code review of 46-1-nodes-yaml-schema-boot-reconciler-peer-type-resolver (2026-05-11)

- `deriveBtpUrl` uses `entry.type` not `entry.id` — collides for multi-peer-per-type. Already acknowledged in Implementation Notes; Epic 46.2 will persist operator-defined URLs into `nodes.yaml`. [`packages/townhouse/src/reconciler.ts:455-457`]
- Concurrent `hs up` invocations would interleave-corrupt `reconciler.log` via non-atomic `fs.appendFile`. Single-operator tool; concurrent invocations not supported. Revisit if a daemon/automation layer ever calls `hs up` from cron. [`packages/townhouse/src/reconciler.ts:115-127`]
- Reconciler ignores `ilpAddress` field-level mismatch — `diff()` only checks set membership of peerIds, not full equivalence. AC4 specifies "missing", not "mismatched". Epic 46.2 may extend to detect drift in routing fields. [`packages/townhouse/src/reconciler.ts:398-422`]
- `writeNodesYaml` does not `fsync` tmp file before rename — power-loss between rename and disk flush could leave a zero-byte yaml. Beyond AC9 scope; consider adding when first multi-host deployment requires durability guarantees. [`packages/townhouse/src/state/nodes-yaml.ts:902-918`]
- `writeNodesYaml` tmp-path collision under concurrent writers — fixed `${path}.tmp` filename. Same out-of-scope reason as the log-interleave item. [`packages/townhouse/src/state/nodes-yaml.ts:909-913`]
- `registerPeer` sends `authToken: ''` for internal Townhouse peers with no validation. Already acknowledged in Implementation Notes; Epic 46.2 may add real auth on internal peer URLs. [`packages/townhouse/src/reconciler.ts:380`]
- No bound on number of sequential `registerPeer` calls — 1000 yaml entries → 1000 sequential 5s-timeout HTTP calls (worst case ~83 minutes blocking apex boot). Scale concern beyond current personal-laptop target. Add concurrency limiter when first power-user with >50 peers shows up. [`packages/townhouse/src/reconciler.ts:372-391`]
- Symlink attack on `~/.townhouse/nodes.yaml` — `fs.rename` follows symlinks and `chmod` chmods the target. Mitigated today by `~/.townhouse` mode `0o700`. Add `O_NOFOLLOW` / `lstat` guard before first multi-user deployment. [`packages/townhouse/src/state/nodes-yaml.ts:65-79`]
- `readNodesYaml` has no file-size limit — operator-edited 1GB nodes.yaml would OOM the CLI. Operator-managed file is non-adversarial input today. Add `fs.stat` size cap if yaml ingestion ever opens to untrusted input. [`packages/townhouse/src/state/nodes-yaml.ts:36-50`]
- `reconciler.log` has no rotation — appends forever, grows unbounded over months of `hs up` invocations. Ongoing-maintenance concern; revisit when Epic 49 telemetry stack lands and a centralized log strategy exists. [`packages/townhouse/src/reconciler.ts:113-127`]
- (from D2 in 46.1 review) Idempotent `hs up` re-print path skips reconciler — current spec'd behavior keeps the re-print free of connector-state mutations, but means drift while apex stays up (e.g. connector restart) is unrepairable without `hs down && hs up`. Revisit when Epic 49 telemetry stack lands an always-on reconciler daemon, or earlier if operators report drift in the wild. [`packages/townhouse/src/cli.ts` `handleHsUp`]

## Deferred from: code review of 46-2-post-and-delete-api-nodes-host-api (2026-05-11)

- `getMnemonic()` is a public plaintext-string accessor returning a live reference; spec-mandated v1 surface but the captured ref outlives `lock()`. Harden when wallet-export flows are reworked or when a public-API consumer materializes. [`packages/townhouse/src/wallet/manager.ts:226-228`]
- `registerPeer` called with `authToken: ''` — in-network-only BTP convention for v1. Generate per-peer random token when the BTP port stops being network-namespace-isolated. [`packages/townhouse/src/api/routes/nodes-lifecycle.ts:370`]
- `stopNodeViaCompose` idempotent-stderr matcher is brittle (substring match against 3 fixed strings) — mirrors existing `downHs` pattern; revisit when first Docker Compose version bump breaks a benign "already-gone" detection in the wild. [`packages/townhouse/src/docker/orchestrator.ts:613-616`]
- `acquireNodeLifecycleMutex` is a per-process boolean — no flock against multi-process race. Single-process v1 constraint; add file lock when HA / sidecar CLI invocations become a real path. [`packages/townhouse/src/api/config-mutex.ts:18-23`]
- Mutex blocks all lifecycle ops (any type) for up to ~4 min during slow provisioning. Per-type mutex is forward work for Epic 47+. [`packages/townhouse/src/api/config-mutex.ts:39-50`]
- `removePeer` doesn't inspect response body for `success: false` shape — connector contract guarantees 2xx = removed today; defensive body-check if connector API ever changes. [`packages/townhouse/src/connector/admin-client.ts:329-379`]
- Atomic-write `.tmp` orphan on ENOSPC mid-write — pre-existing in `writeNodesYaml` from Story 46.1. Add tmp-cleanup catch when first disk-full incident surfaces. [`packages/townhouse/src/state/nodes-yaml.ts:97-112`]
- `waitForHealthy` does not validate URL once before polling — URL is constructed from constants today, but a future operator-configurable port could pass a malformed URL and burn the full 60s. [`packages/townhouse/src/api/routes/nodes-lifecycle.ts:67-88`]
- Mnemonic-in-heap window — `lock()` zeros `state.mnemonic` but previously-captured refs (e.g. inside an in-flight env object) persist until GC. Spec accepts the trade-off; revisit if mnemonic-disclosure incidents materialize.
- `surfaceComposeFailure` regex may miss some compose container-name shapes (no project prefix, very short names). Existing pattern; bundle with `downHs` matcher next time compose stderr format changes. [`packages/townhouse/src/docker/orchestrator.ts:430-460`]
- Healthcheck URL only resolves via Docker DNS — `townhouse-api` runs inside `townhouse-hs-net`; document host-mode fallback if anyone deploys the API outside the network. [`packages/townhouse/src/api/routes/nodes-lifecycle.ts:176`]
- `registerPeer` of same `id` with different route priorities may dup routes — connector spec dedupes by prefix; revisit if route-priority drift shows up in operator reports. [`packages/townhouse/src/api/routes/nodes-lifecycle.ts:371`]
- `removePeer` non-AbortError body-read failure swallows the inner cause and reports the outer "returned 500" without `cause:`. Message-quality polish. [`packages/townhouse/src/connector/admin-client.ts:218-233`]
- `pullImage` may re-pull a digest-form ref when only the tag-form is locally cached (RepoTags vs RepoDigests mismatch). Performance, not correctness. [`packages/townhouse/src/docker/orchestrator.ts:500-518`]
- `runDockerCompose` env override would drop PATH/HOME if a future caller passes `env: {}` without spreading `process.env` — defensive merge for future-proofing. [`packages/townhouse/src/docker/orchestrator.ts:462-474`]
- `enabledAt` uses local clock without NTP-skew documentation — not 46.2-specific; affects reconciler drift classification globally. [`packages/townhouse/src/api/routes/nodes-lifecycle.ts:229`]
- 409 `node_lifecycle_in_flight` lacks `retry-after` / in-flight detail for SPA polling — UX polish. [`packages/townhouse/src/api/routes/nodes-lifecycle.ts:146-150`]
- EACCES on `mill.config.json` write returns a raw error message with no actionable TOWNHOUSE_UID guidance — operator-facing polish. [`packages/townhouse/src/api/routes/nodes-lifecycle.ts:270-283`]
- Mutex acquire pattern is sync test-and-set; future maintainer inserting an `await` between acquire and `try {` would leak the mutex — structural safety today, refactor risk later. Wrap in `withNodeLifecycleMutex(fn)` helper. [`packages/townhouse/src/api/routes/nodes-lifecycle.ts:146-152`]
- Mill happy-path route tests use a mock wallet that always returns FAKE_KEYS — real Solana/Mina derivation in `deriveNodeKey('mill', …)` is never exercised end-to-end. Integration-test gap. [`packages/townhouse/src/api/routes/nodes-lifecycle.test.ts:142-152`]
- Healthcheck-timeout test does not use fake timers; cannot assert AbortController/timer cleanup per iteration. Test polish. [`packages/townhouse/src/api/routes/nodes-lifecycle.test.ts:430-453`]
- Rollback tests don't assert absence of `.tmp` files in homeDir after failure injection — test polish.
- No regression test guarding mutex-leak-on-throw-between-acquire-and-try — pair with the acquire-helper refactor.
- `id = peerId = type` v1 invariant — forward-compat trap when multi-instance support lands; pre-check should switch from `e.type === type` to a richer match. Comment-documented today. [`packages/townhouse/src/api/routes/nodes-lifecycle.ts:170-172`]
- (D4 from 46.2 review) `nodes.<type>.enabled` config flag vs. lifecycle-add — Epic 46 lazy provisioning may have replaced the static flag as the source of truth for HS mode, but the answer was deferred to Story 46.3 (CLI verbs) where it surfaces naturally. Decide whether `townhouse node add` rejects on `enabled: false` or treats the flag as deprecated for lifecycle-managed nodes. [`packages/townhouse/src/api/routes/nodes-lifecycle.ts:131-144`]
> Resolved 2026-05-11 (Story 46.3): HS-mode nodes.yaml is the source of truth. `townhouse node add <type>` ignores `config.nodes[type].enabled` entirely — the static flag is dev-profile only. The TODO(46.3) comment in nodes-lifecycle.ts has been removed.

## Deferred from: code review of 46-3-townhouse-node-add-remove-list-cli (2026-05-11)

- `getPeers()` error classification — any throw maps to `connectorUnreachable: true` masking TLS/auth/parse failures vs network refusal. Distinguish transient connection-refused from misconfigured admin client. [`packages/townhouse/src/api/routes/nodes-lifecycle.ts:148-156`]
- `AbortController` is never explicitly torn down on the fetch success path — signal listener stays attached until GC. Minor per-call leak. [`packages/townhouse/src/cli/node-commands.ts` fetch sites in handleNodeAdd/Remove/List]
- `confirmInteractive` has no SIGINT cleanup — if Ctrl-C races `rl.close()` in the `finally`, terminal may stay in raw mode. Protect with `process.on('SIGINT', ...)` scoped to the prompt. [`packages/townhouse/src/cli/node-commands.ts` confirmInteractive]
- `NODE_ID_PATTERN` accepts unbounded length — server-side fetch will reject, but a megabyte id can be constructed before the network rejects it. Add a sensible client cap (e.g. 64 chars). [`packages/townhouse/src/cli/node-commands.ts`]
- Server-supplied `body.err` is written to stderr unsanitized — `\x1b[...]` ANSI / `\r\b` sequences from a misbehaving connector pass through. Other CLI paths sanitize; this one doesn't. [`packages/townhouse/src/cli/node-commands.ts` error rendering]
- `GET /api/nodes` yaml-read failure returns 500 with raw `err: errMsg` including absolute home-directory path — leaks filesystem layout to API consumer. Strip or redact. [`packages/townhouse/src/api/routes/nodes-lifecycle.ts:135-141`]
- `'disconnected'` status collapses two states: peer-missing-from-connector vs peer-present-but-`connected: false` (handshake pending). No `'pending'` state distinguishes them. Refine in Epic 47/48 when SPA needs the distinction. [`packages/townhouse/src/api/routes/nodes-lifecycle.ts:160-164`]
- `parseArgs({ strict: false })` silently ignores unknown long flags — `townhouse node add town --jsno` runs without `--json`, no diagnostic. Pre-existing CLI-wide pattern; revisit if operator-report rate justifies. [`packages/townhouse/src/cli.ts:1230`]
- DELETE-id regex `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]*$` duplicated client-side without a shared constant — if the server route schema diverges (e.g. allows underscores or longer ids), CLI fail-fast rejects valid ids. Single-source-of-truth refactor. [`packages/townhouse/src/cli/node-commands.ts` NODE_ID_PATTERN vs route schema]
- `STAGE_LABELS` visual order (`Pulling image → Deriving wallet → Registering with apex → Live`) doesn't match server pipeline execution order (which begins with `derive-key`). Minor UX surprise on failure-step display. [`packages/townhouse/src/cli/node-commands.ts` STAGE_LABELS]
