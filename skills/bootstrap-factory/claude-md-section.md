## The AFK factory

`ready-for-agent` is the factory's queue (`docs/agents/triage-labels.md`). When an issue
carries it and its blockers are closed, `.github/workflows/agent-implement.yml` runs
`.sandcastle/agent-implement-issue.ts`, which runs `/mattpocock-skills:implement`, then
`/mattpocock-skills:code-review` against `main` in a fresh session, then the gate, then
pushes `sandcastle/issue-N` and opens a PR labelled `ready-for-human`. A failed run moves
the issue to `needs-triage`. Specs, blocked issues, issues with an open PR and any issue
labelled `wayfinder:*` are skipped (`.sandcastle/ready-issues.ts`). A human merges every PR.

**The gate reads its steps from CI.** The gate is the `run:` steps of the `gate` job
(else the `checks` job) of `.github/workflows/ci.yml` **on `main`**, in order. If there is
no `ci.yml`, no such job, or no runnable step, the gate runs nothing and logs that loudly.
[GATE TODAY: one or two sentences from bootstrap.sh's gate output. Either name the steps it
runs, or say that it runs nothing and the review is the only check, and that naming the
first CI job `gate` (or `checks`) makes the factory gate on it with no further change.]
The rule lives in one place, `gateFromCi` in `.sandcastle/run-gate.ts`, tested by
`.sandcastle/run-gate.test.ts`.

The runner's own commands, from `.sandcastle/`: `npm ci`, `npm test`, `npm run typecheck`.
The runner's only Node manifest is `.sandcastle/package.json`, separate from anything at
the repository root. The sandbox image is the shared
`ghcr.io/toon-protocol/sandcastle-agent`; this repo has no Dockerfile for it.
`close-linked-issues.yml` is identical in every factory repo. Its source is
`templates/factory/` in `toon-protocol/toon-meta`, so change it there first.
