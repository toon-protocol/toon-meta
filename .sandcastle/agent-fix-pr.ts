// Single-PR repair runner — the entry point the `agent:fix` label→runner
// workflow (.github/workflows/agent-fix.yml) invokes when the PR repair pass
// (toon-meta#357, scripts/factory/{repair,automerge}-evaluator.mjs +
// auto-merge.mjs) applies `agent:fix` to a PR whose ONLY blocker(s) are red
// checks and/or a merge conflict.
//
// Mirrors .sandcastle/agent-review-pr.ts's single-PR mechanics (fetch the PR
// head as a local branch, run one sandboxed agent pass against it, push any
// commits back to the SAME PR — never a new one), swapping the reviewer role
// for a fixer role (sonnet, up to 60 iterations — a repair is scoped and
// bounded by the evaluator's own retry/repair budgets, DEFAULT_REPAIR_BUDGET
// = 2, so this runner does not also need implement's full 100-iteration
// budget).
//
// THE LOAD-BEARING PART (#357's own words): this runner REMOVES its own
// `agent:fix` label when it finishes, WHATEVER THE OUTCOME (fix pushed, no
// changes made, or the run itself threw) — never only on success. Three
// labels have already been found that an automated step applies and nothing
// automated clears: `agent:implement` (#330), `needs:human` (#352),
// `agent:review` (#355). This must not become a fourth. Removing the label
// unconditionally also re-arms `repair-evaluator.mjs`'s
// `hasAgentFixInFlight` gate, so the NEXT auto-merge pass evaluates this PR
// fresh (still red → another `repair` attempt against the budget, or
// `escalate` once the budget is spent — never silently stuck "in flight"
// forever).
//
// RESIDUAL GAP, stated rather than hidden: "whatever the outcome" covers every
// outcome of THIS PROCESS — the outermost `finally` runs whether the fixer
// pushed, changed nothing, or threw. It cannot cover the process never getting
// that far: a throw in the setup above it (the `gh pr view` / `git fetch`
// before the try), or a job-level kill (the 25-minute step timeout, a cancel).
// Those leave `agent:fix` on the PR, and nothing else clears it — the same
// exposure `agent-review-pr.ts` has for `agent:review`. If it bites, the fix
// is an `if: always()` label-clearing step in agent-fix.yml, which survives a
// runner kill in a way an in-process `finally` cannot.
//
// STANDALONE MECHANICS: same worktree conflict agent-review-pr.ts documents
// (sandcastle checks the PR head out in its own worktree, so the workflow
// checks out `main` and this runner materialises the PR head as a local
// branch itself before createSandbox()).
//
// This runner NEVER submits a review verdict and NEVER merges — it only
// pushes fix commits back to the PR. The existing review pass (agent:review)
// and auto-merge pass re-evaluate the PR on its own `synchronize` trigger.
