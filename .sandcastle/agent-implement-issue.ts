// Single-issue PR-mode implement runner — the entry point the
// `agent:implement` label→runner workflow (.github/workflows/agent-implement.yml)
// invokes for ONE explicitly-labeled issue.
//
// How this differs from the full autonomous loop in `main.ts`:
//   - main.ts  = the multi-issue autonomous engine: Phase 1 planner scans ALL
//                open `agent:implement` issues, Phase 2 implements+reviews them
//                in parallel, Phase 3 MERGES every branch into the checked-out
//                branch and CLOSES the issues. That is the "auto-merge" engine,
//                reserved for later (backlog draining).
//   - this file = human-in-the-loop, ONE issue, and by default it OPENS A PR
//                 and STOPS. A human reviews and merges. There is no planner
//                 (the issue is already chosen by the label event) and, in the
//                 default mode, no merge phase at all.
//
// FIRST-RUN SAFETY / AUTO-MERGE TOGGLE
// ------------------------------------
//   SANDCASTLE_AUTO_MERGE unset | "false"  (DEFAULT, safe):
//       implement -> review -> push branch + open a PR (deterministic, no agent).
//       Nothing is merged; the issue is NOT closed; a human merges the PR.
//   SANDCASTLE_AUTO_MERGE = "true"  (re-enable once the pilot is trusted):
//       implement -> review -> merge the branch into the checked-out base and
//       close the issue (the stock merge-prompt.md). NOTE: the stock merge
//       prompt's push-to-origin semantics are inherited from the engine and are
//       themselves verify-on-first-run — do not flip this on until the PR path
//       has been proven and you have confirmed how the merge lands on main.
//
// The toggle lives in ONE place (this env var, read below) and is documented in
// agent-implement.yml.
//
// This is a DOCS repo: the sandbox gate the prompts run is the doc gate
// (`npm run lint:md` / `check:links` / `validate:json`), not lint/typecheck/
// test/build. Everything else is identical to the code-repo runners.
//
// Required env:
//   SANDCASTLE_ISSUE_NUMBER   the issue to work (github.event.issue.number)
//   CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN   Claude Max-plan credential (org secret)
//   GH_TOKEN                  token with contents:write + pull-requests:write +
//                             issues:write (the App token in CI)
//   APP_ID, APP_PRIVATE_KEY   the same GitHub App GH_TOKEN is minted from. Used
//                             to mint a FRESH token immediately before each
//                             push, because installation tokens expire after
//                             one hour and long runs pushed with a dead
//                             credential (connector#462; ported here as
//                             toon-meta#248/#334) — see ./mint-app-token.ts.
//                             HOST ONLY: the private key is deliberately absent
//                             from PASSTHROUGH_KEYS in ./sandbox-secrets.ts, so
//                             it never enters the sandbox container. Optional —
//                             without it the runner falls back to the ambient
//                             GH_TOKEN and the old expiry behaviour.
//
// Usage:
//   SANDCASTLE_ISSUE_NUMBER=123 npx tsx .sandcastle/agent-implement-issue.ts
//   # or: npm run sandcastle:implement   (with SANDCASTLE_ISSUE_NUMBER exported)
