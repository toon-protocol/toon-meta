// Single-PR review runner — the entry point the `agent:review` label→runner
// workflow (.github/workflows/agent-review.yml) invokes when `agent:review` is
// applied to ONE pull request.
//
// This is the single-pass replacement for the old 4-round `review-round:*`
// reviewer loop. It runs the reviewer role (review-prompt.md — two axes:
// Standards refinement + Spec review against the PR's target issue) against
// the PR's head branch, pushes any refinement commits back to the PR, and
// REQUIRES a structured verdict (toon-meta#275):
//   - the reviewer must emit <review>{"verdict":"clean"|"blocking",
//     "blockingFindings":[{file,line,summary,why}]}</review>; a malformed
//     verdict fails the run (one engine-style resume retry, then non-zero exit)
// The verdict is then submitted FORMALLY as the factory-ops identity
// (toon-meta#282, FACTORY_OPS_TOKEN):
//   - "clean"    → a real APPROVE review (a machine verdict — see FACTORY.md,
//     "What a factory-ops approval attests")
//   - "blocking" → a REQUEST_CHANGES review carrying the findings, plus the
//     `needs:human` label
// The approver must never be the PR author: the identity is resolved and
// compared against the author BEFORE the reviewer runs (fail fast) and again
// at submission; a missing/expired/wrong-identity token FAILS the job loudly
// rather than degrading to a COMMENTED review.
// It NEVER merges the PR and NEVER closes anything.
//
// STANDALONE-REVIEW MECHANICS (proven live on connector#634's first run):
//   Sandcastle checks the PR head branch out in its OWN worktree under
//   .sandcastle/worktrees/, and git refuses one branch in two worktrees — so
//   the workflow checks out MAIN, never the PR head. Because the local clone
//   is then on main, this runner materialises the PR head as a LOCAL branch
//   (git fetch origin +head:head) before createSandbox(): without it the
//   engine's `worktree add` falls back to `-b <branch> HEAD`, silently
//   reviewing an EMPTY diff off main. review-prompt.md's {{TARGET_BRANCH}}
//   resolves to the checked-out branch (main), so the diff base is right.
//
// The target issue for the Spec axis is resolved from the PR body's
// `Closes #n` (the implement runner writes one into every factory PR body).
// PRs without a closing reference get a Standards-only review.
//
// Required env:
//   SANDCASTLE_PR_NUMBER      the PR to review (github.event.pull_request.number)
//   CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN   Claude Max-plan credential (org secret)
//   GH_TOKEN                  token with contents:write + pull-requests:write +
//                             issues:write (labels)
//
// Usage:
//   SANDCASTLE_PR_NUMBER=42 npx tsx .sandcastle/agent-review-pr.ts
//   # or: npm run sandcastle:review   (with SANDCASTLE_PR_NUMBER exported)
