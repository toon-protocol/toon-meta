// Single-PR review runner — the entry point the `agent:review` label→runner
// workflow (.github/workflows/agent-review.yml) invokes when `agent:review` is
// applied to ONE pull request.
//
// This is the single-pass replacement for the old 4-round `review-round:*`
// reviewer loop. It runs the reviewer role (review-prompt.md — improve doc
// clarity/consistency while preserving meaning, enforce CODING_STANDARDS.md)
// against the PR's head branch, and pushes any refinement commits back to the
// PR. It NEVER merges the PR and NEVER closes anything — a human still merges.
//
// STANDALONE-REVIEW CAVEAT (verify on first run)
// ----------------------------------------------
// Sandcastle 0.12.0 exercises the reviewer only INSIDE the parallel loop's
// Phase 2, on a fresh `sandcastle/issue-*` branch it just created. Driving the
// same reviewer standalone against an already-existing PR head branch is our
// interpretation, not a documented engine feature. Two things to confirm on the
// first live run:
//   1. createSandbox({ branch: <existing PR head> }) checks out the EXISTING
//      branch (rather than failing because the ref already exists / creating a
//      divergent one). The workflow checks out the PR head first to help this.
//   2. The built-in {{TARGET_BRANCH}} inside review-prompt.md resolves to `main`
//      for a standalone sandbox. If the diff comes back empty, the base may be
//      resolving wrong — check the reviewer's logged `git diff` command.
//
// Required env:
//   SANDCASTLE_PR_NUMBER      the PR to review (github.event.pull_request.number)
//   CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN   Claude Max-plan credential (org secret)
//   GH_TOKEN                  token with contents:write + pull-requests:write
//
// Usage:
//   SANDCASTLE_PR_NUMBER=42 npx tsx .sandcastle/agent-review-pr.ts
//   # or: npm run sandcastle:review   (with SANDCASTLE_PR_NUMBER exported)
