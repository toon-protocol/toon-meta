Contracts: Deployed payment channel registry

---

## ✅ **Confirmed Working**

### 1. Payment Channel Infrastructure
```bash
curl http://localhost:8081/admin/channels
# Response: [] (empty array = infrastructure enabled)
```

**Result:** ✅ **ENABLED**
Payment channel infrastructure successfully initialized with Base Sepolia testnet contracts.

**Evidence from logs:**
```
{"event":"payment_channel_sdk_initialized","registryAddress":"0xCbf6f43A17034e733744cBCc130FfcCA3CF3252C","tokenAddress":"0x39eaF99Cd4965A28DFe8B1455DD42aB49D0836B9","peerCount":0,"msg":"Payment channel infrastructure initialized"}
```

### 2. Settlement Monitoring
```bash
curl http://localhost:8081/admin/settlement/states
# Response: [] (empty array = monitoring active)
```

**Result:** ✅ **ACTIVE**
Settlement threshold monitoring running with 1-minute polling interval.

**Evidence from logs:**
```
{"event":"settlement_monitor_started","threshold":"1000000000000000000","peerCount":0,"pollingInterval":60000,"msg":"Settlement threshold monitoring started"}
```

### 3. Balance Tracking
```bash
curl http://localhost:8081/admin/balances/node-echo
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "peerId": "node-echo",
  "balances": [
    {
      "tokenId": "ILP",
      "debitBalance": "0",
      "creditBalance": "0",
      "netBalance": "0"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Result:** ✅ **WORKING**
Balance tracking operational, showing debit/credit/net balances per peer.

### 4. Peer Management with EVM Addresses
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/admin/peers \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "id": "node-echo",
    "url": "ws://node-echo:3000",
    "authToken": "test-token",
    "evmAddress": "0x7669e9322044006F4125919027917Ad5daF74D7B"

5. **Wallet Integration** - Connected to Base Sepolia with live contracts

---

## 🚀 **Next Steps for Full End-to-End Testing**

To test actual payment flow with balance changes and on-chain settlement:

### 1. Connect Two Real Peers
Deploy a second Crosstown node with agent-runtime to establish actual BTP connection.

### 2. Create Payment Channel
Once peers are connected, payment channels will auto-create or can be triggered via API.

### 3. Send Real ILP Packets
With connected peers, packets will flow and balances will change.

### 4. Observe Settlement
When balance exceeds threshold (1 M2M), automatic settlement will trigger on-chain.

### 5. Verify On-Chain
Check Base Sepolia explorer for settlement transactions:
```bash
# Check channel contract state
https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/0xCbf6f43A17034e733744cBCc130FfcCA3CF3252C

# Check wallet balance
https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/0x2A4b89D2b272C89Ae1DE990344cD85AA91826A52
```
